            <h5>CRT NOW AND THEN</h5>
            <p>The College for Research and Technology of Cabanatuan (CRT) is a pioneering computer school in Nueva Ecija. It introduced a unique approach to education by incorporating competency courses into its bachelor's programs, setting a trend followed by other institutions. The college's president, Dr. Reynato C. Arimbuyutan, established a strategic plan to open campuses in all four districts of Nueva Ecija, aiming to offer quality education to students in their local areas. The first branch, Gapan Branch, opened in 1997, with plans for a dedicated campus in the future. Two more branches, Guimba Campus and San Jose Campus, were built, offering technical courses alongside ladderized education. The college also gained permits to operate senior high schools across its branches. CRT has been recognized by CHED, TESDA, and DepEd for its TechVoc education expertise. Recent achievements include the completion of new buildings and a gymnasium, as well as various championship wins in sports and competitions. All baccalaureate degrees offered by CRT are recognized by CHED, and the college's growth can be attributed to scholarships, quality education, and improved facilities.</p>
